# Ruby-2
Welcome to my game!

First, it will ask weather you want to play the game or not; if yes, it will print out "Okay, let's go", whereas if no, it will print out "Alright, bye!" and terminate the program.

If continued, it will ask questions like...

1. Is Python a creature or a programming language?
2. What is a float in Python, JavaScript, Java, and Ruby?
3. What is HTML used for?

and more :)
